# 🧠 Gas Bottle Detection & Tracking using YOLO

## 📘 Project Context

This project is part of an AI-based monitoring system designed to **detect and track gas bottles moving on a conveyor belt** in real-time.  
Using a fine-tuned YOLO model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), the solution provides automated detection, labeling, and tracking directly from live video streams or stored footage.

The system supports **on-site deployment** and aims to enhance:
- Quality control  
- Production efficiency  
- Safety monitoring  
- Inventory tracking

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
### Step 1: Create directory `models` and `videos`
```Bash
mkdir -p models videos
```
Inside directory `videos`, create another directory called `output`
```Bash
cd videos
mkdir -p output
cd ../
```

  </ul>
and place them in "models" directory.

### Step 3: Update `config.py`
Update the path of all variables in `config.py` (except for TRACKER_CONFIG_PATH):
- GAS_BOTTLE_DETECTION_YOLO_PATH: `yolo11n_bottles.pt`
- TARRA_AND_YEAR_DETECTION_YOLO_PATH: `new_yolo11s_extract_tarra_weights.pt`
- CLASSIFIER_MODEL_PATH: `convnextv2_base_trained.pth`
- VIDEO_INPUT_PATH: path to the downloaded video
- VIDEO_OUTPUT_PATH: add `/output` before the video name in VIDEO_INPUT_PATH
- GROUND_TRUTH_PATH: path to the ground truth file


### Step 4: Run the algorithm
For Windows:
```bash
python track-gas-bottle.py
```

For macOS:
```bash
python3 track-gas-bottle.py
```

## Main algorithms
- `track-gas-bottle.py` : Gas bottle tracking from one source video.

## ⚙️ General Algorithm Architecture

### 🤖 Gas Bottle Inspection and Tracking Algorithm

This algorithm is a comprehensive computer vision pipeline designed to **track, inspect, and log data** from gas bottles moving in a video feed. It acts as a **smart automated inspector** that watches the video, spots the bottles, gives them unique IDs, checks if they're safe (OK/NOT OK), and tries to read their tarra weight and recertification year.

### 🛠️ Core Components and Technologies

The algorithm relies on several advanced machine learning models and libraries:

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object Detection** | **YOLOv8** (from `ultralytics`) | Detects the **location** of the gas bottles (the object) and the **location** of the stamped text (tarra weight/year). |
| **Tracking** | Integrated Tracker (e.g., BOT-SORT/ByteTrack) | Assigns a stable, consistent **ID** to each bottle as it moves across frames. |
| **Classification** | **ConvNeXtV2** (via `timm`) | A trained model for **binary classification** (OK/NOT OK) of the bottle's visual condition. |
| **Text Reading** | **EasyOCR** | An Optical Character Recognition library used to **read** the numbers/text (weight and year) from the detected text regions. |

### ⚙️ Key Operational Functions

#### 1. Tracking & Identification 🎯

* **Goal:** To give each individual gas bottle a unique ID and follow it throughout the video.
* **Process:** The `yolo.track()` function assigns an internal `track_id`. The code maps this to a clean, consecutive `display_id` for reporting (`id_mapping`).

#### 2. Condition Classification ✅/❌

* **Goal:** Determine the safety status of the bottle (OK or NOT OK).
* **Process:** The `classify_gas_bottle` function extracts the bottle's image (Region of Interest or **ROI**) and feeds it to the **ConvNeXtV2 classifier**.
* **Data Storage:** The highest confidence classification and label (`ok` or `nok`) are stored persistently in the `id_ocr_data` dictionary for that bottle's ID.

#### 3. Reading Stamped Data (OCR) 🔢

* **Goal:** Extract the **Tarra weight** (e.g., 10.8 kg) and **Recertification Year** (e.g., 2025) stamped on the bottle.
* **Function:** `extract_text_with_ocr`
    * Uses **`text_yolo`** to precisely locate the tiny stamped text regions.
    * Applies **image preprocessing** (CLAHE, rotations) to enhance the often faint text.
    * Uses **`EasyOCR`** to read the characters.
    * **Stabilization:** Stores multiple OCR results per bottle (`ocr_memory`) and uses a **majority vote** (`Counter`) to select the most *stable* reading over time, increasing reliability.
    * **Validation:** Uses **Regular Expressions** to confirm the extracted values are valid weights ($\text{X.X}$) and years ($\text{20XX}$).
    * **Automatic Flagging:** If the extracted recertification year is older than the `CURRENT_YEAR`, the bottle is automatically flagged as **"nok (expired)"**.

#### 4. Output and Reporting 📊

* **Video Output:** Draws the bounding boxes, `ID`, classification, Tarra, and Year directly onto the video frames before saving to the `output_path` (e.g., `videos/output/...mp4`).
* **CSV Log:** The `save_csv_data` function writes all the final, stabilized data for every tracked bottle into a structured `.csv` file (`_tracking_data.csv`).
* **Performance Analysis (Optional):** If a **Ground Truth** file is found, the algorithm:
    * Compares its classifications against the known labels.
    * Calculates a **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report**.
    * Generates a heatmap image of the Confusion Matrix to visually represent the model's accuracy.
